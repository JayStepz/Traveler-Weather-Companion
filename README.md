## Overview
Use this to check the current weather and 5-day forecast of any city in the US.
## How to Use
Simple usage: Type the name of the city you want to check the weather of, then click the search button!
The current weather will display in the top box along with today's date and the city name.
The 5-day forecast will display in the lower 5 boxes along with the respective dates.
Every search will also display a history underneath the search button for each search.
(Those buttons don't currently work, though. My apologies.)
